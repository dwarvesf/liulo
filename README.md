# Liu lo app

The Simplest Interactive Q&amp;A Opensource Platform At Events. This could be the beginning of a meaningful conversation.

## How to use

#### Ask or vote
To ask a question, simply go to **www.liulo.io/at** and enter a one-time passcode. Participants can also vote for questions submitted by other users. Questions will be sorted by popularity.

#### Allow, edit or block questions
With three simple “Allow”, “Edit” and “Block” buttons, you can have complete control of your event by filtering your audience’s inputs before they are seen by the rest of the users.

#### Projector Panel
Display the top 9 most voted questions submitted by your audience on the big screen. They will then see the questions automatically sort themselves in real-time as the votes change.

#### Moderator Panel
As the moderator, you can identify the questions that interest more people in the audience and address them on the spot. Tap “Active” to bring the question up onto the Projector Panel. When you’re done, simply tap “Answered” and the question will be removed.

#### Complete anonymity
All responses recorded and received are anonymous by default. This way, your audience can be empowered to ask questions that matter.

#### Social profiles
Users also have the option to sign in through Facebook, Twitter or LinkedIn to give their question an identity.

## Why we make it

We were inspired from *Pigeonhole Live* and we believe that open source software should be good as sex so we make it. 

At first time, we target on Vietnamese users, startup community and tech meetup event.

### Q&A Sessions Done Right

**No longer restricted by a microphone**. Everyone can now speak up, including the shy genius among your audience.
Public speaking anxiety. Fear of sounding silly. Long-winded questions. And more long-winded questions. These are some of the problems that have been plaguing Q&A sessions for the longest time ever.

With Líu lo, every audience can now ask questions that matter to them and let their voices ‘be heard’, even when they’re feeling a little shy.

**Address the popular questions**. Hit-or-miss at Q&A Sessions, no more.
Quality of Q&A Sessions often relies on the choice of questions posed by the moderator and the questions at the microphones. A good Q&A Session does not have to be left to chance.

Let your audience decide and vote for questions that interest them. Questions with higher votes will stand a better chance to be addressed by the Moderator.

**Focused, Audience-driven Plenary Discussions.**
Plenary discussions bring together the brightest minds across expertise areas for a cross-functional conversation. Yet, it is incredibly challenging to drive a well-balanced yet provoking discussion that addresses the audience’s interest, especially during the Q&A Session.

Liu lo is designed to bring the focus back to Plenary Discussions. With the audience posing their questions on Liu lo, event owners can weed out the inappropriate questions and only allow those that add value to the discussion.
